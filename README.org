* Emacs

Emacs is awesome.
Unfortunately, my config is a mess.
This is my config, sanitized.

I use Emacs 28, the =feature/native-comp= branch.
Commit for this configuration: =400f620f24b90540f71673a998c41327237330be=
Commit =32c6732d16385f242b1109517f25e9aefd6caa5c= ("* lisp/emacs-lisp/byte-run.el (make-obsolete): Make `when` mandatory") was reverted because it broke packages.

I use an Emacs Starter, named *DOOM*, that makes my life easier.
